;; REVISIT: Add lenv support to the inspector.
;;
;; The idea behind this feature is that the inspector should make it possible
;; to evaluate expressions in the local environment of a closure being inspected.
;; There are a couple possible implementation strategies for this, both with issues.
;;
;; 1) Fix inspect-eval to pass the lenv into repl-eval, assuming the context has a
;;    lenv. This evaluates all inspector forms in the lenv, including inspector
;;    commands. This might be confusing to the user, and if the lenv happens to contain
;;    a binding for an inspector command, it allows the inspector to be disabled.
;;    Probably a bad idea to do this, unless some kind of safeguard can be taken. It
;;    _might_ be simple enough to stick the inspector into its own package and
;;    ensure that all the inspector commands are bound to symbols local to that package.
;;   This still has the underlying problem, but it's simple to implement, and you'd
;;   have to work pretty hard to screw yourself up.
;;
;; 2) Add an :eval command to the inspector that allows forms to be explicitly
;;    evaluated in the closure's lenv. This fixes the user confusion issue, at the
;;    expense of requiring the user to type in :eval for every evaluation. The downside
;;    to this is that is that the :eval command itself would be a repl abbreviation
;;    that would have to have some way to refer to the lenv of the current inspector
;;    context. The repl abbreviation mechanism is not set up to do this... the only
;;    thing I can think of is that the inspector creates a lenv that contains
;;    bindings that refer to the current inspector context. (This could possibly
;;    be inspect-eval's lenv, for that matter).  The repl abbreviation could then
;;    expand to a form that contains references to bindings in that lenv. This
;;    gives the repl abbreviation access to the local context and therefore any
;;    lenv defined in that context. (This lenv would introduce name conflict issues
;;    similar to those mentioned in option 1).
;;
;; 3) Implement option 2, but forget trying to reuse the repl abbreviation mechanism.
;;    This is simple, but we lose the help infrastructure, etc. that we get by
;;    default as a part of that mechanism.
