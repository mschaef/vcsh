** 0.7 - Fix Instances, Structures, and Generic Functions
*** type-of does not allow instances to return anything other than instance
*** scheme-core allows for default values from slot-ref, although lislot_ref doesn't support them.
*** Add support for setting slots via @(inst slot-name) syntax
*** Remove uses of structure

** Backlog
*** Clean up calling conventions in fasl-write
*** Switch Lisp stack to lref_t's
*** Move argument buffers onto Lisp stack
*** Add FOP's for looping, etc. Switch loop forms to FOPs
*** Switch to numeric-coordinate based lexical binding lookup
*** Add support for caching lexical frames on the lisp stack.
*** Split out character codec's from I/O in the io package.
*** Add SHA-1 hash logic, preferably inside the VM, rather than in an outside library
*** Add test case coverage
*** Verify correct operation of directory tools on both *nix and Windows.
*** There's a lot of commonality in the config.unix/config.windows files. Unify that into something simpler.
*** Add a compiler option that emits a cross reference file describing global references.
*** Remove boxed fixnums
*** Add bignums
*** Swich to a memory-size based heap sizing model rather than a segment-count based model.
*** Linear bytecode compiler
*** Complete complex arithmetic
*** FFI (SIOD-FFI?)
*** Statisics that pass statistical reference data sets
*** char-ci=?, etc. has _terrible_ memory characteristics (70-80 conses per call)
*** Incorporate some kind of regex library
*** convert %with-disabled-interrupts to functional form
*** should list-all-packages really be all-packages ?
*** define instead of define-method trashes the entire generic fn. Not too user-friendly. (define rollback history)
*** add define/global set! hook to invalidate generic fn caches on class graph changes
*** Ensure structures use vectors as storage for auto slots
*** Replace class graph with above network of symbol refs
*** Switch to Unicode character encoding
*** Add Unicode translation modes to character streams
