vcsh TODO
================================

0.6 - Janitorial Work
--------
* Add test case coverage
* Verify correct operation of directory tools on both *nix and Windows.
* Split out the public scan API into its own header file
* There's a lot of commonality in the config.unix/config.windows files. Unify that into something simpler.
* Add a more proactive heap enlargement policy. (To the GC hook)
* Swich to a memory-size based heap sizing model rather than a segment-count based model.
* Add a compiler option that emits a cross reference file describing global references.
* Specifying no files to 'vcsh -c' causes a run time error.
* gen-register-calls.scm produces output that CL thinks is Mac format... something wrong with CR/LF translation?

0.7 - Short-term Performance
--------
* Switch Lisp stack to lref_t's
* Move argument buffers onto Lisp stack
* Add FOP's for looping, etc. Switch loop forms to FOPs
* Switch to numeric-coordinate based lexical binding lookup
* Add support for caching lexical frames on the lisp stack.

0.8 - Fix Instances, Structures, and Generic Functions
--------
...

Later
--------
* Linear bytecode compiler
* Complete complex arithmetic
* FFI (SIOD-FFI?)
* Statisics that pass statistical reference data sets
* char-ci=?, etc. has _terrible_ memory characteristics (70-80 conses per call)
* Incorporate some kind of regex library
* convert %with-disabled-interrupts to functional form
* should list-all-packages really be all-packages ?
* define instead of define-method trashes the entire generic fn. Not too user-friendly. (define rollback history)
* add define/global set! hook to invalidate generic fn caches on class graph changes
* Ensure structures use vectors as storage for auto slots
* Replace class graph with above network of symbol refs
* Switch to Unicode character encoding
* Add Unicode translation modes to character streams




vcalc TODO
================================
* Deferred rendering of clipboard contents (set-clipboard-data takes a closure...)
* Load global state command
* List ops (nth, length,  map, for-each, every?, any?, sum, group-by, product, member, cons)
* poly-line
* set-graphics-clip
* rename multiple-eval to repeat
* Data set macro apply
* dataset nth/mth column extract
* Quick Register
* find, assoc, filter, remove
* Romberg Integration
* Secant/Bisection Solver
* Normal Distribution/Erf
* (visit ...) in lisp
* Flow-based text layout
* Periodic Table of the Elements

* NPV
* Keymap refinements - Layered Modes
* Custom menus
* Decorationless window
* 'Linger' message (sent if mouse stays put)
* Bond Calculations
* Depreciation
* GCD/LCM/IsPrime/Factor
* binary number bit width
* Retarget default save file
* Provide a way to update the display from Scheme code, guard for reentrancy
* Switch to one scalable banner image
* Add/Test fast-write/fast-read
* needs to be a break facility to interrupt long calculations/evaluations
* Interface freezes during long macro execution
* Tip of the day defaults to off
* Remove MFC
* cord/rope implementation of strings
* Read only symbol scoped bindings
* Move evaluation code into leval
* O(1) lexical binding lookup
* Emacs bundles subr metadata with the subr itself, this is a _good_ idea
* Start defining the interface to Scan more cleanly
* get-window-image, get-desktop-image
* Keyhelp window doesn't autoslide
* interactive stack
* Progress dialog box
* Grid-dataset editor
* Hyperbolic trig
* >2 columns/dataset
* named dataset columns
* computed datset columns
* dataset query/join
* dataset XML export/import
* infix expresion parser
* tip of the day in main window
* tool tips
* lisp-name->c-name and vice-versa (see: dotty.scm)
* conditional trace
